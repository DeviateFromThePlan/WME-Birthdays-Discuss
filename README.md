# <p align="center">WME Birthdays (Discuss)</p>

A script that pulls the birthdays from Discuss to be pasted into Discord.

Half written by ChatGPT (work smarter not harder lol). Image has been taken from the original version of the script.

Pulls Birthdays from this link: https://www.waze.com/discuss/cakeday/birthdays/today
